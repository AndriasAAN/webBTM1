    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the Batumarta 1 Digital Hub application, focusing on news management, photo gallery, website customization, and secure admin access. The structure emphasizes authorization independence and clear security rules. \n\n**Authorization Independence:** Authorization independence is achieved by storing all authorization information directly within the documents that require protection. In this design, we leverage the `roles_admin` collection for administrative access. The Firestore rules check for the existence of a document with the user's UID in the `roles_admin` collection, which authorizes admin actions. This avoids complex `get()` calls and ensures atomic operations.\n\n**Structural Segregation (Homogeneous Security Posture):** Data with different access requirements are stored in separate collections. News articles and gallery photos, which are publicly readable but only editable by admins, are stored in the `news_articles` and `gallery_photos` collections, respectively. Website settings, which are exclusively for admin access, are stored in the `website_settings` collection.\n\n**Access Modeling:** The design follows consistent access modeling patterns:\n\n*   **Global Roles (DBAC):** The `roles_admin` collection grants admin privileges based on document existence. A user with a document in this collection is considered an admin.\n\n**QAPs Support:** The design supports QAPs (Rules Are Not Filters) by enabling secure `list` operations. Publicly readable data (news articles, gallery photos) can be listed without complex filtering in the rules. Admin-only data (website settings) are protected by existence checks in the `roles_admin` collection.\n\n**Invariants:** The structure supports data integrity by enforcing strict rules on data creation, modification, and deletion. For example, only admins can create, update, or delete news articles and gallery photos."
